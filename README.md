Government Intervention in   the Market   for   Vapes
Write an essay   of   no more than 1200 words   (no headings or   sections) on the   following   scenarios   and   questions
Assume a country in   which many people use   vapes containing nicotine.   There are health   concerns because of   this.
Researchers estimate that :
Supply of   Vapes is given by:                                 QS   =   0.1P -   2
And
Demand   for   Vapes is given by:                        QD   =   40   – 0.05P
P isin pence per millilitre [ml]          (eg P = 100:    = 100 pence/ml    = £1/ml)   and:
Qs and QD   are quantity of   vape (in thousands of litres) supplied/demanded in   the   country per   year
Assume:
•          all   vapes are homogenous (no   variation in active content)
•         the   vape market is competitive, and all producers are price   takers.
1.      Create and explain a diagram showing   Demand and Supply curves and showing
market-clearing   Price (P) and Quantity (Q) and Producer Surplus (PS) and Consumer   Surplus (CS).
[10%]
The Government imposes a   tax on sales (paid by   the seller) of   Vapes at a   fixed rate of 150
pence   per   ml of   vape
2.      Create a diagram showing how this tax changes   the market-clearing   equilibrium.            Explain (in   terms a non-economist can understand) if   / how   the   tax changes supply   and demand curves.
[10%]
3.      Create a diagram showing the changes in P, Q, PS, CS and   Tax Revenue after the tax   has been imposed.   Calculate and explain:
•          price paid by consumers and price received by producers
•          changes in PS and CS at equilibrium.
Explain   the diagram (in terms a non-economist can understand)
[20%]
4.      Critically   discuss   the impact of   the   tax, highlighting strengths and   weaknesses.   What   effects, in addition   to   those shown in   your diagrams, might occur because of its
imposition.
[25%]
Researchers discover the relationship between price and demand for   vapes used above is   incorrect, in   fact   the Q demanded is given by:
QD   =   80   – 0.1P
5.      Create a diagram showing (the changes in) demand curve, P, Q and PS, CS and   Tax   Revenue after   the   tax has been imposed.
Explain how and   why   this change   will affect   the tax incidence compared   to   the initial   result.
[25%]
[10%]   will be   awarded   for   the quality   of   the writing   and   structure.
